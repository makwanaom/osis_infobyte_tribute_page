                    Bruce Lee, Chinese name Li Jun Fan, (born November 27, 1940, San Francisco, California, U.S.â€”died
                    July 20, 1973, Hong Kong), American-born film actor who was renowned for his martial arts prowess
                    and who helped popularize martial arts movies in the 1970s.Lee was born in San Francisco, but he
                    grew up in Hong Kong. He was introduced to the entertainment industry at an early age, as his father
                    was an opera singer and part-time actor.The younger Lee began appearing in films as a child and was
                    frequently cast as a juvenile delinquent or street urchin. As a teenager, he took up with local
                    gangs and began learning kung fu to better defend himself. At that time he also started dance
                    lessons, which further refined his footwork and balance; in 1958 Lee won the Hong Kong cha-cha
                    championship.
